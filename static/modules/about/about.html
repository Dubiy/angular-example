<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Ihor Dubiy. I am a software developer. I deal with production of sites and web-applications. I am experienced in creation of various systems starting with simple applications with API up to high-loaded systems with server scaling on the Amazon Web Services Platform. If it is appropriate I use CMS Drupal or Wordpress. I create frontend with the help of modern libraries and frameworks, e.g. Angular JS. Also I am keen on hardware creation on developing. I develop microcontrollers ESP8266, ATMEGA328, ATTINY85. Sometimes I create robots :)
Some of these projects are presented in the <a ui-sref="main.portfolio">portfolio</a>.</p>
